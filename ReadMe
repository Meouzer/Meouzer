Did you know that robust deep copying depends on typing. We have the following, but first our data 
can be infinitely complex. You can have Sets whose members are Maps whose keys are ArrayBuffers and 
values are typed arrays. The set can also have properties that are DataViews whose properties are 
Maps whose properties are Sets whose properties are ArrayBuffers.

(1) The typing system you wish JavaScript had.
	
(2a) The stringify() function that dumps objects for debugging and more.
	
(2b) The parseDataString() that creates data objects from strings.
	
(2c) stringify() serializes and parseDataString() deserializes so that parseDataString(stringify(x)) 
	 is a deep copy of x. Infinitely complex data can be deep copied (circular references
     supported).
	
(3)  The deepCopyData() function also deep copies data and can handle circular references 
	
(4) deepCopySystem can be used to deep copy classes, i.e., class instances of programmer defined classes.
